# Transolver (ICML 2024 Spotlight)

:triangular_flag_on_post:**News** (2025.07) We have released the code of [Transolver++](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02414v1). Please check this [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/thuml/Transolver_plus).

:triangular_flag_on_post:**News** (2025.04) We have released [Neural-Solver-Library](https://github.com/thuml/Neural-Solver-Library) as a simple and neat code base for PDE solving. It contains 17 well-reproduced neural solvers. Welcome to try this library and join the research in solving PDEs.

:triangular_flag_on_post:**News** (2025.02) We present an upgraded version of Transolver, named [Transolver++](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02414v1), which can handle million-scale geometries in one GPU with more accurate results.

:triangular_flag_on_post:**News** (2024.10) Transolver has been integrated into [NVIDIA physicsnemo](https://github.com/NVIDIA/physicsnemo/tree/main/examples/cfd/darcy_transolver).

Transolver: A Fast Transformer Solver for PDEs on General Geometries [[Paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02366) [[Slides]](https://wuhaixu2016.github.io/pdf/ICML2024_Transolver.pdf) [[Poster]](https://wuhaixu2016.github.io/pdf/poster_ICML2024_Transolver.pdf)

In real-world applications, PDEs are typically discretized into large-scale meshes with complex geometries. To capture intricate physical correlations hidden under multifarious meshes, we propose the Transolver with the following features:

- Going beyond previous work, Transolver **calculates attention among learned physical states** instead of mesh points, which empowers the model with **endogenetic geometry-general capability**.
- Transolver achieves **22% error reduction over previous SOTA in six standard benchmarks** and excels in **large-scale industrial simulations**, including car and airfoil designs.
- Transolver presents favorable **efficiency, scalability and out-of-distrbution generalizability**.

## Transolver v.s. Previous Transformer Operators

**All of the previous Transformer-based neural operators directly apply attention to mesh points.** However, the massive mesh points in practical applications will cause challenges in both computation cost and capturing physical correlations.

Transolver is based on a more foundational idea, that is **learning intrinsic physical states under complex geometrics**. This design frees our model from superficial and unwieldy meshes and focuses more on physics modeling.

As shown below, **Transolver can precisely capture miscellaneous physical states of PDEs**, such as (a) various fluid-structure interactions in a Darcy flow, (b) different extrusion regions of elastic materials, (c) shock wave and wake flow around the airfoil, (d) front-back surfaces and up-bottom spaces of driving cars.
